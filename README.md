# Semantic-Analysis-using-News-Api-Data

In this project, I have used cleaned NewsApi data, news articles to compute TF-IDF (term frequency-inverse document frequency) based on the keywords: Canada, Halifax, Canada Education, University and Dalhousie University. At first, I found the count of articles where each of these keywords appeared and the count of the terms (keywords) in each of the documents. The I computed the log of the number of the total documents where the term appeard divided by the total count of the term that appeared.
